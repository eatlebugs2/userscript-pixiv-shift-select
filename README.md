# userscript-pixiv-shift-select
Userscript for shift-key multiselection in Pixiv's bookmarks page.

I'm not a programmer and this was written by AI, so use at your own risk. 

Selecting a bookmark item, then holding Shift while selecting another bookmark item will automatically select everything between those two bookmarks.
Shift+Ctrl+Click for deselecting.
## Known bugs
- No support for selecting a range spanning multiple pages w/ a single click, you have to go through the pages manually.
- It will sometimes glitch and randomly select text, very annoying.
